    <h1>About Techno Music</h1>
    <p>Techno music is known for its repetitive beats and hypnotic rhythms, which create a trance-like state for the listener. 
    <p>It has been influenced by a variety of genres, including funk, jazz, and rock music.
    <p>In the 1980s, the state gave birth to one of the most popular music genres today: techno music. 11 different types branched out of it later on.
    <p>Contrary to common belief, techno music isn’t the same as EDM. 
    <p>Instead, it’s one branch of it, along with House, Dubstep, and similar genres.
    <p>Techno is usually repetitive, 4/4 instrumental music with heavy percussion-abass drum on each quarter note pulse, plus a backbeat played by a snare orequivalent-and little to no lyrics. The tempo also tends to range between 120and 150 beats per minute. Any rule can be broken individually, but break toomany, and it stops being techno.
Overlap exists with other sub genres of electronica, such as house, synthpopand disco. However, the latter two tend to be more lyrically oriented and mellowthan techno. House music, meanwhile, is much more complex and more relianton distortion and clipping (the effect created when an electronic sound is
overdriven).
    <p>又称科技舞曲、高科技舞曲、铁克诺等，是一种电子音乐的曲风，也是一大类电子音乐的总称。 刻板印象中的科技音乐，旋律简单重复，机械冰冷而富有科技感。但不乏也有温暖致幻的作品。有观点说，它最初的灵感来源于重工业中的噪声。往往没有卓破（Drop）部分，乐曲结构十分严整规律。往往为4/4拍。 历史上，科技音乐在八十年代中期形成于美国底特律。不过推倒柏林墙后的德国柏林也有着独特的科技音乐亚文化。科技音乐如今有各种子曲风，但底特律科技音乐（Detroit Techno）仍被认为是所有分支曲风的基石。</p>
